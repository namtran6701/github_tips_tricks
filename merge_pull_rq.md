Merge/Pull Request

In order to collaborate with other developer on github, we need to do as follow. 

1. Create a copy of the repo by forking it to your own repository. 

2. As the developer has made some changes to the code, they can request the repo's owner to add changes to the main repo by using pull request 

3. The repo's owner can review the change and decide whether they should merge the new changes (Merge Pull Request) to the main repo or not. They can view the changes in "Files changed"

Once all changes on the branch have been merged to the main branch, there will appear a "Delete branch" button on the pull request page that allows us to remove the branch.
